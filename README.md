# Legends_Hall
I designed and built a responsive webpage that is interactive and hopefully fun for the user. The design is built around something I am a super fan of. So I picked blues and blues guitarists.
This webpage was made with HTML, CSS, and JS (JavaScript).
I used iterative process slides that I worked on over time, which helped me plan out and see how my work evolved.
This information will be linked in the Iterative Process Slides
I completed UX and UI testing in order to get feedback on the first iteration of my webpage.
That information will be in the UX and UI testing PDF linked.
